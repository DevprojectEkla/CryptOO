	The full name of the program is Cryptoman.
	
 	NEW 1.2: This new release of Cryptoman allows you to do a full directory encryption and/or decryption.
	         At the end of the en/de-cryption an archive of the directory is automatically generated.
		 Beware not to try to encrypt too big datas because of high memory usage.

	Ancient options remain:
        Crypto can also both encrypt and decrypt a text file. 
	A file of the encrypt (resp. decrypt) text is saved in the format "Crypt_Filename.txt"(resp. "Decrypt_Filename.txt").
	In a soon future we hope Crypto will be able to encrypt all kind of data and to automatically generate a mail to 
	be sent to the user define contact under the pseudo of his choice.

	Have fun using it and please report any bugs or share your own view with us at Crypto_Support@gmail.com (fictive mail)
